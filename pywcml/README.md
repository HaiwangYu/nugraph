# pywcml

Utilities for converting Wire-Cell ML NPZ dumps into NuGraph-compatible HDF5 datasets.

This package exposes a small API and the `wcml_to_h5.py` script for turning NPZ files
generated by the Wire-Cell machine learning pipeline into datasets consumable by
NuGraph training code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Run the command above from the `pywcml/` directory inside the NuGraph repository.
Make sure the companion `pynuml` package is also available on your Python path when
using the conversion utilities.
